# Ansible Collection - galaxyproject.general

A collection of simple Ansible roles for common (mostly system) tasks.

These roles are not intended for production or community use at this time. They are a conversion to the collection
format from the previous [git submodules](https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-collection-general/tree/submodule)
used internally by the [usegalaxy-playbook](https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook) and
[infrastructure-playbook](https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook) playbooks.

## Usage

```console
ansible-galaxy collection install galaxyproject.general
```
